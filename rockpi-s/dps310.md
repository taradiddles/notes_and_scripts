## monitoring

I use snmpd's `extend` feature to run the python script and return the values for use in Zabbix. This is probably much lighter than installing zabbix-agent and using a custom userParameter entry.

eg. snmpd.conf: `extend  weather /path/to/the/python/script`

this can then be accessed at oid `NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull."weather"`, eg. with `snmpget -v2c -c community -On rockpi-s 'NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull."weather"'`

notes:

- fix permissions according to your setup. Eg. instead of adding the snmpd user to the i2c group, I'm running the script with sudo and a properly configured sudoers.d entry.
- add locking to prevent concurrent use - eg. if concurrent snmp queries are sent. (on my setup I also store the values to a temp file and read them from there if they're not older than x seconds ; I can upload the script it if someone is interested).

zabbix: see the exported xml template; it's using a snmpv2 type (snmpv1 would work too) using the oid above and two dependent items for pressure/temperature, parsing the main item with a regex (eg.  `(^| )temp:(-?[0-9\.]+)( |$)`).
